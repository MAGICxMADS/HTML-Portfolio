<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is Madison and I am 25 years old and looking to make a career switch from Human Resources into Web Development. 
  My degree is in Business Administration, but when I was in school I never had a solid idea of what I wanted to do when I graduated. Post graduation I got lucky and was offered a full time position working as a Technical Recruiter for Amazon!
At Amazon, my job was to hire mid-senior level software engineers for roles within Amazon's AWS Network Services Team.
While I enjoyed my time at Amazon, I felt that recruiting wasn't for me and that I could do more. After recently being laid off, I thought about what I wanted to do as a career and what I wanted my future to look like. 
That was when I made the decision focus my free time into studying web development.
That is what landed me here.. making this webpage, so welcome and I'm glad you're here!</p>

<p>This project is a very general portfolio webpage where I can document what I have learned and worked on thus far in the course.
  So far I have learned the basics of HTML, and I must say I have gained so much knowldge in the short time that I have been working on this course.
  I feel excited for what is to come and proud of what I have accomplished!
