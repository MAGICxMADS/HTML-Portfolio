<h1>Madison's Must-Watch Movies</h1>
<h2>This is a list of my top 3 favorite movies of all time!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Proposal</h3>
<p>This is a great movie to watch if you're in the mood for a Rom-Com. Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock make the perfect couple as they try to scheme their way into a promotion and staying in the country.</p>
<h3>The Parent Trap</h3>
<p>As a triplet, this movie hold s a special place in my heart. Two twins who never knew eachother existed meet at summer camp and come up with a plan to switch places to they each could meet the other parent they've never seen before. It is a classic.</p>
<h3>Coco </h3>
<p>This is a great family movie with amazing animation and music. Beautiful story of family and passion. The end will bring tears to your eyes.
